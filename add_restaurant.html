                    Shillong}</h3>
                <p>Zomato enabled me to restart my operations post-COVID when I had no hope of doing my business again.
                    I'm grateful to the platform for helping me thrive - my online ordering business has done so well,
                    it has even taken over my dining business!</p>
                <img src="img/v.png" alt="">
                <h3>Vijay {Owner - Birgo,
                    Coimbatore}</h3>
                <p>Thanks to Zomato's invaluable support, our startup cloud kitchen has been doing wonders in the
                    competitive food industry landscape. Their dedication to promoting local businesses and powerful
                    reporting tools have been instrumental in our success, and we look forward to a long-term
                    partnership.</p>
